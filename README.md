# Seattle Spark Meetup
This is the [Seattle Spark Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Spark-Meetup/) GitHub repository which contains presentations, blog posts, meeting notes, and generally fun Spark stuff.

Join us at [Seattle Spark Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Spark-Meetup/) as we have monthly meetups on all things Spark in Seattle and on the Eastside (we do our best to alternate between the two sides of Lake Washington).
